# Tik Tak Toe Game Site Project

In this exciting project, a Tik Tak Toe game site is being created where users can play against the computer and customize the game with an aesthetic interface. The technologies used in the project, the key features of the game, and detailed explanations are presented below.
## Project Objectives
This game project aims not only to provide a fun Tik Tak Toe game but also to deliver a user-friendly experience utilizing modern technologies effectively. The main objectives of the project are:
- **Artificial Intelligence Integration:** The game's foundation is built on artificial intelligence algorithms, providing users with a game experience where they can compete with real intelligence.
- **Use of React.js:** The user interface, game board, and other components are created using React.js. This ensures a dynamic and interactive gaming experience.
- **AI Assistant with Node.js:** Node.js is employed in the development of the AI assistant. The assistant aims to guide players. However, the connection part is not yet completed.
## Game Features and Details
### User-Friendly Entry Screen
The project includes an aesthetic entry screen that welcomes users. Font styles, color palettes, and dimensions are carefully selected to provide users with a pleasant welcome.
### Game Options and List
The game offers the option to play on boards of different sizes: 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7. Users can make their preferences and view information such as the game start time, player name, and selected board size in the game list.
### Colorful Gaming Experience
In the third part of the game, the colors chosen by the user are used in the game area. This feature not only personalizes the game but also provides a visually rich experience.
### Results and Replay
When the game ends, in the case of a tie, players return to the beginning. If one side wins, they are redirected to a second page. Players can exit the game anytime using the "Exit" button.
